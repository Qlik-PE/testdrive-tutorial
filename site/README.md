Test Drive "site" Subdirectory
=====
This directory contains the files that are used to build the html and corresponding website that
is hosted by the test drive VM (and actually executed by the test drive docker image).

At the present time, web pages are created using a markdown language called
[Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) and the html that is hosted by the
test drive docker image is generated from there using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
This may change as the user experience and the corresponding content evolves.
