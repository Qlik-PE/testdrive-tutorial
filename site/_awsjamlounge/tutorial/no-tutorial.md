Sorry, but there is no tutorial here for you to peruse. 
A step-by-step tutorial would go against the principals of 
the Jam Lounge.

If you need help, you have two options:

* Click on one of the **Clues** on the AWS Jam home page for the Qlik Lounge.
* Review the documentation for Qlik Replicate, which you can locate from the 
Resources page.

Good luck!
