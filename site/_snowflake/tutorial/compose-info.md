The next phase after you’ve streamed data into Snowflake is to consider how to
operationalize the setup, ongoing care, and feeding of your newly minted
warehouse. In a typical data warehouse, most of the initial deployment time and
effort is spent writing ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) code to create data marts
that are used for reporting.  Additionally, even more energy is expended
amending the ETL code as the business and warehouse change over time. 

Qlik Compose for Data Warehouses automates the time-consuming
tasks of building and maintaining data warehouses and data marts. It’s
model-driven approach generates the necessary artifacts and ETL scripts to
automatically manage your entire data warehouse lifecycle. As a result,
business analysts and data architects experience substantial productivity gains
that speed the time to insight. 

For example, ETL coding of a typical data warehouse consumes about 75% of the
initial deployment effort. However, because Compose generates the appropriate
ETL code, that time is practically reduced to zero. Also, Compose proactively
monitors and manages environmental changes as the data warehouse alters over
time. Compose identifies the differences, performs impact analysis, and
directly modifies ETL scripts, data warehouse structures, and data mart tables
with no manual intervention. Compose is a truly nimble solution that enables a
dynamic and agile data warehouse to match the realities of every modern
business.


### Qlik Compose for Data Warehouses Features

Qlik Compose for Data Warehouses provides an intuitive, web-based graphical
user interface divided into four sections: Databases, Models, Data Warehouses,
and Data Marts. These sections orchestrate the lifecycle of your Snowflake data
warehouse.

##### Databases

The *Databases* tab defines the connection to both the Snowflake instance and the
data sources that will populate the warehouse.

##### Model 

The *Model* tab is used to describe the entities and relationships that will live
in the Snowflake data warehouse. Models are clearly understood by both data
warehouse architects and business analysts and can be created with the Compose
UI or generated by importing logical or physical models from design tools like
ErWin.

The model tab is the origin of many of the automation processes that generate
data warehouse tables and ETL logic.

##### Data Warehouse

The *Data Warehouse* tab controls what happens when the model is deployed. It
creates the physical tables in the Snowflake data warehouse and define mappings
that determine how data is correlated, loaded and transformed when ingested.

##### Data Mart

The *Data Mart* tab walks you through a simple wizard to generate analytics-ready
data marts. Compose allows you to select the type of data mart you want to
build whether transactional, aggregated, or state-oriented conforming to a star
schema design pattern illustrated below:

##### Operational Capabilities

Compose also contains various operational features to ease administration,
scheduling and monitoring of data warehouse automation tasks. The integrated
workflow engine enables you to run all your data warehouse and data mart tasks
as a single, end-to-end process both sequentially and in parallel. In addition,
you can either run workflows manually or schedule them to run at specific
times. Consequently, the data in your Snowflake instance will always be up to
date and in sync with your transactional data systems.

Compose also provides additional operationalization capabilities including
change management and documentation generation.
