Let’s review what you’ve accomplished in the course of this tutorial:

1. Configured MySQL as a data source
2. Configured resources in Microsoft Azure needed for replication into Databricks
3. Configured Databricks to make it ready to receive data from Qlik Replicate.
4. Configured Databricks as a data target
5. Created a data replication task
6. Created a data transformation function  
7. Executed the replication task to load data from MySQL into Databricks

In the next section we’ll explore how we can take the data that we are replicating
and create an ODS in Delta Lake using Qlik Compose for Data Lakes.
